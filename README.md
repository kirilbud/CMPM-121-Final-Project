# CMPM 121 Final Project

## Introducing the team

* Tools Lead: Ashley Seward
* Engine Lead: Mae Saltz
* Design Lead: Mae Saltz
* Testing Lead: Marina Uriostegui

## Tools and materials

1. Engine: Our primary rendering engine will be the THREE.js library with our own physics engine. THREE.js is a high-level rendering engine with a lot of support and tutorials that are easily accessible.
2. Language: We will be using a mix of TypeScript and JavaScript since they work well with THREE.js.
3. Tools: We will use GitHub as version control and page hosting, and Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension for testing. While these tools are not cloud-based, they provide a simple and reliable environment for development.
4. Generative AI: We plan on keeping AI to an absolute minimum and only using it for debugging as a last resort. We are not fans of generative AI being in the creative process, and the only AI we will be adding is pathfinding.


## Outlook

* What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?

We are hoping to create a Lemmings-like game with an intuitive level editor for speeding up the development process.

* What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?
  
The riskiest part of this project would be attempting to add some sort of twist on the Lemmings formula to avoid making a reskin of Lemmings.

* What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?

We hope to learn how to better incorporate programming and refactoring patterns into our games, such as using the Flyweight pattern on our characters to keep memory usage down.
